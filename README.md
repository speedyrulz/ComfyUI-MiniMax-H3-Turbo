# ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo

Run [MiniMax-H3](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/minimax/minimax-h3) —
joint **video + synchronized audio** — in **4 sampling steps** instead of ~20,
with the [MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA](https://huggingface.co/larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora).

Two nodes that drop straight into the official H3 workflow (text-to-video and
image-to-video):

| node | what it does |
|---|---|
| **MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA** | `MODEL → MODEL`, applies the turbo LoRA |
| **MiniMax-H3 Turbo Sampler (4-step)** | `→ SAMPLER`, feeds `SamplerCustomAdvanced` |

> ⚠️ **Preview.** The current LoRA (`ckpt850`) is the final checkpoint of this
> training round — sharp at 4 steps, but with known artifacts emerging
> (plastic-looking skin, over-sharp grain); training is paused while we fix them.
> See the [LoRA repo](https://huggingface.co/larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora) for
> details.

## Install

> 🔄 **Keep the node updated.** It's actively evolving and features arrive in new
> versions (e.g. pruned-base support was added after the first release). Update
> via ComfyUI-Manager, or `git pull` if you installed manually.

**Via ComfyUI-Manager** — search "MiniMax-H3 Turbo" and install.

**Or manually:**
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/speedyrulz/ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo
```
Then restart ComfyUI.

**Download the LoRA** from
[larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora](https://huggingface.co/larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora)
and put the `.safetensors` into `ComfyUI/models/loras/`.

You also need the base MiniMax-H3 model, VAEs and text encoder from the official
release — see the [MiniMax-H3 tutorial](https://docs.comfy.org/tutorials/video/minimax/minimax-h3).

## Use

Start from the **official MiniMax-H3 workflow** (t2v or i2v) and make two changes:

1. Insert **MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA** between the model loader and the sampler
   (`... → Load Diffusion Model → MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA → SamplerCustomAdvanced`),
   and pick the turbo `.safetensors`.
2. Replace the sampler feeding `SamplerCustomAdvanced` with **MiniMax-H3 Turbo
   Sampler (4-step)**, and set the scheduler node to **4 steps**
   (`BasicScheduler`, scheduler `simple`).

Everything else — the conditioning nodes, VAE decode, audio output — stays as in
the official workflow, so **both text-to-video and image-to-video** work
unchanged. A ready-made t2v workflow is in
[`example_workflows/`](example_workflows/minimax_h3_t2v_turbo.json) — drag it
into ComfyUI to see the wiring.

**Base model**: works with any MiniMax-H3 base — full (`bf16`, `int8_convrot`)
**and the pruned/curve variants** (`pruned_int8`, `pruned_fp8`). The node detects
a pruned base automatically and re-injects the LoRA's time-conditioning at run
time (a small `silu(t_emb)` grid ships with the node for this), so one LoRA file
covers every base.

## Why a custom sampler (and how it adapts)

MiniMax-H3 denoises the video and audio streams on two different flow schedules
(video shift 12, audio shift 3). **Recent ComfyUI handles this natively** — its
`ModelSamplingAV` carries the audio latent on the video schedule — so a stock
sampler already produces correct audio there. On **older ComfyUI without that
support**, a stock sampler steps both streams on one schedule and badly over-steps
the audio at 4 steps, so the audio comes out distorted or blown out.

This node's sampler **auto-detects which ComfyUI it's running on**: on recent
builds it steps as a plain single-schedule sampler (bit-for-bit the stock result);
on older builds it steps each stream on its own clock so audio stays clean at 4
steps. Keep it in the workflow and it does the right thing across ComfyUI versions
— you don't need to change anything when you update ComfyUI. (On recent ComfyUI a
stock `euler` sampler works too; the Turbo Sampler just keeps existing graphs
working unchanged.)

## Notes

- **Steps**: with `ckpt850`, **4 steps is already sharp** (earlier checkpoints
  needed 6–8). Any count **≥ 4** is valid; more steps still help a little.
  Scheduler stays `simple`.
- **LoRA strength** (node input, default `1.0`) is the dial for the
  sharpness/artifact trade-off: if the result shows **blurry ghosting / smear**,
  nudge strength **up** (e.g. `1.05–1.2`); if it shows **over-sharp grain /
  artifacts**, nudge it **down** (e.g. `0.8–0.95`).
- **Resolution / length**: width and height are multiples of 32 (short edge
  typically 768); frame count is at 24 fps and snaps to the model's 17·k+5 grid
  (124 ≈ 5 s). Validated range ~124–362 frames.
- **VRAM / `low_vram`**: MiniMax-H3 is large (~33 B). The LoRA node has a
  **`low_vram`** switch that trades sharpness for peak VRAM:
  - **off (default)** — applies the LoRA at run time (bypass): sharpest, and the
    recommended path, but costs some extra peak VRAM.
  - **on** — merges the LoRA into the weights: lowest peak VRAM, so smaller GPUs
    can run and longer / higher-res clips fit, but the result is **softer on
    quantized (`int8` / `fp8` / pruned) bases**, because the tiny update is
    partly rounded away when it is folded back into the quantized weights.

  If you hit an out-of-memory error, turn `low_vram` **on** (and/or lower the
  resolution or frame count). The node streams the base model, so it also runs
  on much smaller GPUs than the ~33 B size suggests — an 80 GB GPU is only
  needed for the largest resolutions in `bypass` mode.
